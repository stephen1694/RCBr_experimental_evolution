Brief overview of methods:
We combined experimental evolution with the resurrection approach on a variety of rapid-cycling Brassica rapa (RCBr, aka field mustard) to explore adaptation to experimental drought in a population with an extreme phenology trait.
We founded 12 experimental populations from outcrossed lines of RCBr and randomly assigned each population to an Evolution History: we assigned 4 populations for storage as ancestors, 4 to experimental drought, and 4 to well-watered conditions.
During four generations of experimental evolution, drought Evolution History populations received a draw-drown drought treatment aimed to mimic Mediterranean drought while well-watered Evolution History populations were watered every other day.
After experimental evolution, we grew all experimental populations (ancestors included) under unstressed (well-watered) conditions to reduce maternal and storage condition effects across the different Evolution Histories.
We then grew two seeds (siblings) from each individual while applying a watering treatment with one sibling from each individual under each treatment in what was the test generation. This design allowed us to assess evolutionary responses (ancestor-descendant regime comparisons) and plasticity (watered-drought treatment comparisons) to experimental drought to assess drought response strategy. 
Detailed methods and the assocated results are discussed in the assocated manuscript published in the American Journal of Botany.

Data files:
For each file, the data is found in the first tab while an explanation of each variable is provided in the second tab.  
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2022_AJB_individuals_data.xls" includes traits measured for individuals during the test generation of the experiment (flowering time, specific leaf area, and seed mass). 
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2022_AJB_WUE_data.xls" contains data for water-use efficiency, which is a trait that was measured on a pool for each experimental population during the test generation. 

Code files:
The file named "Johnson_et_al_2022_AJB_code.txt" contains all code used to generate results included in the AJB journal article. This code is explained with comments throughout the text file.
